				Farming is a major input sector for economic development of any
				country. Livelihood of majority of population of the country like India depends
				on agriculture. In this project, it is proposed to develop a Smart Farming System
				that uses advantages of cutting edge technologies such as IoT, Wireless Sensor
				Network and Cloud computing to help farmers enhance the way farming is
				done. Using sensors like temperature, humidity, moisture etc. are used to get
				information about the field and help farmers to take precise decisions on
				insights and recommendations based on the collected data.
